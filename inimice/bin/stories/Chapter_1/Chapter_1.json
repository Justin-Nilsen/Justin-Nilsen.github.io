        "text": "<h1>Chapter 1</h1><p>The rhythmic clatter of the subway car reverberated through the cabin, a mechanical symphony underscored by the occasional hiss of hydraulics as it sped along its magnetic rails. Matoran sat by the window, his reflection faintly visible against the rain-streaked cityscape of Polaris. Buildings stretched like glowing spires into the overcast sky, their tops obscured by low-hanging clouds. Neon advertisements flickered against the gloom, promising everything from synthetic luxuries to bio-enhancements, their colors blurring into streaks on the wet glass.</p><p>The car was neither packed nor sparse, a balanced hum of life. To Matoran's left, a group of Eridani teens with orange skin and sharp-pointed ears joked in a language he didn’t recognize. Across the aisle, an elderly Artakan man with silver hair and black-sclera eyes sat in serene silence, a soft glow reflecting off his data slate. A human woman, dressed in the deep blue of a sharp business suit, stood near the door, steadying herself against a pole, her attention fixed on a holographic projection of the stock market.</p><p>Matoran adjusted his jacket collar, pulling it closer against the residual chill that clung to him despite being indoors. The nerves about his interview at the Emissarium buzzed louder than the warmth of the heating vents could reach. His foot tapped an anxious rhythm on the floor. The Emissarium's administrative building was an imposing place, and securing a position there—any position—meant stability in a city where dreams often crumbled beneath its shining facade.</p><p>The subway car slowed, the brakes emitting a prolonged whine as the next station approached. More passengers streamed in, water droplets rolling off umbrellas and damp coats. A tall man with a weathered face, likely a miner or mechanic from one of the outer systems, took the seat directly across from Matoran. His clothes smelled faintly of grease and ozone, and his boots looked like they had seen too many cycles without repair.</p><p>The man leaned back, studying Matoran with the casual curiosity of someone looking for a way to pass the time. “You look sharp,” he said, his voice gravelly yet warm. “Got somewhere important to be?”</p><p>Matoran hesitated, his gaze flitting between the man and the rain beyond the window.</p>",
