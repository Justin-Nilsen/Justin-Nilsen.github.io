Lightning turned the skyline into a strobe-lit battlefield, skyscrapers caught in sharp relief before fading back into the wet gloom. <span class=\"inline-code\">console.log('HAHA! It works!');</span> From the top floor of the Parallax Spire, <u>New Atraments</u> sprawled below, a fractured mosaic of neon advertisements, aircar trails, and glimmering towers. But tonight, it all felt too exposed. Too precarious.</p><p>Matoran sat at the bar, swirling a glass of amber liquor that hadn’t earned a single sip. The room felt wrong, charged like the air before a strike. A couple of executives—Syndicarian blue ties practically shouting their allegiances—sat in a corner booth, their conversation hushed but pointed. Across the room, a broad-shouldered man in a cheap suit was pretending to read his datapad, glancing up too often for comfort. And then there was the Eridani near the wall, their orange skin glowing faintly under the dim light. They sat alone, nursing a drink that looked expensive, their ceremonial blade resting just far enough out of reach to make a statement: <em>Don’t test me.</em></p><p>Matoran’s foot tapped against the bar rail, a steady rhythm that betrayed {his} nerves. The last time {he} met this source, the place had practically erupted. Private security from their corporation—<em>sent to make a point</em>—had swarmed the bar mid-conversation. Matoran barely made it out, ditching a back exit while the source had to fight their way through. Tonight wasn’t going to be any cleaner if they weren’t careful.</p><p>The door hissed open behind {him}, a whisper against the storm outside. Matoran didn’t turn immediately, catching the distorted reflection in the mirrored liquor shelves. A figure stepped in, rain dripping from a long black coat. Hood up, face hidden. They scanned the room, deliberate, methodical.</p></div><div class=\"ql-tooltip ql-hidden\"><a class=\"ql-preview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"about:blank\"></a><input type=\"text\" data-formula=\"e=mc^2\" data-link=\"https://quilljs.com\" data-video=\"Embed URL\"><a class=\"ql-action\"></a><a class=\"ql-remove\"></a></div>",

But he’s got a wound to the neck, likely from a cutting tool of some kind, and it’s a clean job. Whoever did this knew what they were doing.” The detective glanced at the victim’s body, a frown crossing his face. “No defensive wounds either. Looks like he knew his killer.”\n\nMatoran nodded, taking it all in, his mind already running through the possibilities. A calculated murder, no doubt. Clean, methodical, but why here? Why now?",

His words seemed to hang in the air, heavier than the rain tapping against the window.\n\nThe room stilled, the murmur of voices ceasing as everyone turned to look at him. The Syndicarian detective blinked, a flicker of surprise passing across his face, before he gave a short, almost dismissive laugh.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" the man replied, his voice colder now, a mix of disbelief and growing irritation. \"You want me to—what? Take off my pin?\"",

People he was involved with?” Matoran asked, his voice low, carefully probing.\n\nThe Syndicarian glanced back at him, almost wary, as if Matoran had just ventured into a territory he wasn’t supposed to. “We’re working on that. His social media’s active—he was all over the place, rallying for Eridani rights, pushing against the AU. You know the type.” The detective let the words hang in the air, but Matoran felt the unspoken edge—the political context was as dangerous as it was unavoidable.\n\nMatoran paused, letting the weight of the situation settle. There were too many factions with reasons to be involved in this. But someone, somewhere, had made a statement. And it was his job to figure out which message it was.\n\n=== END ===",

Public speeches, rallies, the whole deal. Slit throat, no witnesses, no clear motive—except for maybe everything he stood for.”",
